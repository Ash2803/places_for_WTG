    "description_long": "<p>This open-air market, located near Republic Square, focuses on Armenian souvenirs only and the choice is so big everyone can find something interesting here. From rugs and paintings to pomegranate earrings or keychains – literally everything is here. The Vernissage is open every day, from 7:00 in the morning till 18:00 (although the opening hours can be shorter when the weather is bad or it’s the holiday season). Another, smaller open-air market with paintings only is located near the Opera, in Martiros Saryan Park.</p>",
