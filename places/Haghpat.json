    "description_short": "The name of the fortress means “fortress in the clouds” in Armenian language and that is very accurate as the site is located 2.300 meters above the sea level, on the slopes of Mount Aragats, the highest mountain in the country.",
    "description_long": "<p>The citadel was built between the 10th and 13th century and used to be one of the most important defense points on the Armenian territory. Today you can still admire the remnants of the fortress as well as Vahramashen Church from the 11th century, the bathhouse and the hidden passage to the river Arkashen.</p>",
