    "description_short": "Located around 100 km north from Yerevan, in the heart of Dilijan National Park, Dilijan is often called “Armenian Switzerland”. This famous and important spa town was founded in 1544, however, the area was inhabited already in the Late Bronze and early Iron ages.",
    "description_long": "<p>Dilijan is known for lush forests surrounding the city, perfect for the relaxation and long walks, but there are also a few other attractions. From the town, you can go for a short hike to Jukhtak Vank, the semi-abandoned monastery from the 11th century, hidden in the forests surrounding the city. Not far from it there are ruins of another monastery, Matosavank from the 13th century, but this one is more difficult to find. Not far from Dilijan there is another monastery worth visiting, Haghartsin, dating to the 13th century. This is actually the complex of three monasteries, the architecture is simple, a bit raw inside but still very impressive. From the monastery, you can admire a beautiful view of the surroundings. But the main reason to visit Dilijan is to inhale clean, fresh air and enjoy beautiful nature around.</p>",
